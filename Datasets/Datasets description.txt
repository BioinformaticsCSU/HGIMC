MSNMF algorithm could conduct drug-disease predictions on two datasets: Fdataset_ms and Cdataset_ms, which can be loaded by matlab.

(1) Fdataset_ms
Wrname: the DrugBank IDs of drugs;

Wdname: the OMIM IDs of diseases;

drug_ChemS: chemical structure similarity matrix;

drug_AtcS: drug's ATC code similarity matrix;

drug_SideS: side-effect similarity matrix;

drug_DDIS: drug-drug interaction similarity matrix;

drug_TargetS: drug's target profile similarity matrix;

disease_PhS: disease phenotype similarity matrix;

disease_DoS: disease ontology similarity matrix;

didr: disease-drug association matrix.

(2) Cdataset_ms
Wrname: the DrugBank IDs of drugs;

Wdname: the OMIM IDs of diseases;

drug_ChemS: chemical structure similarity matrix;

drug_AtcS: drug's ATC code similarity matrix;

drug_SideS: side-effect similarity matrix;

drug_DDIS: drug-drug interaction similarity matrix;

drug_TargetS: drug's target profile similarity matrix;

disease_PhS: disease phenotype similarity matrix;

disease_DoS: disease ontology similarity matrix;

didr: disease-drug association matrix.

Tips:
Fdataset_ms is obtained from the supplementary material of paper Gottlieb et al., 2011.
[Gottlieb et al. PREDICT: a method for inferring novel drug indications with application to personalized medicine[J]. Molecular systems biology, 2011,7(1), 496.];

Cdataset_ms is downloaded from the supplementary material of paper H Luo et al.,2016.
[H Luo et al. Drug repositioning based on comprehensive similarity measures and Bi-Random Walk algorithm[J]. Bioinformatics, 2016, 32(17).];

We collected drug_AtcS, drug_SideS, drug_DDIS, drug_TargetS, and disease_DoS for Fdataset_ms and Cdataset_ms.
