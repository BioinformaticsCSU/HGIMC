# HGIMC
Inspired by the low-rank completion of BNNR and the guilt-by-association principle of HGBI, we propose a heterogeneous graph inference with matrix completion (HGIMC) method to predict potential indications for drugs. The code of HGIMC in this package is implemented in Matlab2014a.

Description: 
"Demo_HGIMC.m" demonstrates the experimental result on Fdataset_ms by HGIMC algorithm.
